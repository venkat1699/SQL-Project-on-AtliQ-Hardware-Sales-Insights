# SQL-Project-on-AtliQ-Hardware-Sales-Insights
 Welcome to the AtliQ Hardware Sales Insights project! This project is a culmination of my SQL learning journey, completed under the guidance of mentors Dhaval Patel and Hemanand at codebasics.io  


AtliQ Hardware is an imaginary company, and this project aims to provide valuable insights into its sales data. The project includes a series of SQL queries, stored procedures, and data analysis to answer various business questions and improve decision-making.
