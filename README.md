# SQL-Project-on-AtliQ-Hardware-Sales-Insights
 Welcome to the AtliQ Hardware Sales Insights project! This project is a culmination of my SQL learning journey, completed under the guidance of mentors Dhaval Patel and Hemanand at codebasics.io  


AtliQ Hardware is an imaginary company, and this project aims to provide valuable insights into its sales data. The project includes a series of SQL queries, stored procedures, and data analysis to answer various business questions and improve decision-making.

Learning journey
This project marks the beginning of my SQL learning journey. It allowed me to learn & apply SQL concepts to real-world data analysis and gain practical experience.

Here are some of the highlights of what I learned and practiced during this fantastic journey:

✨ INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and CROSS JOIN: Gained a solid understanding of different types of joins and how to effectively combine data from multiple tables.

✨ Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries: Explored the power of subqueries, understanding how they can be nested and correlated to handle complex queries efficiently.

✨ Common Table Expressions (CTE): Leveraging CTEs enhanced my query readability and learned to tackle complex problems step by step.

✨ Stored Procedures: Understanding the concept of stored procedures allowed me to modularize code and enhance database performance.

✨ Database Views: Grasped the significance of database views in simplifying complex queries and providing a structured interface to access data.

✨ Window Functions: Learned how to use the powerful OVER clause, along with functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to analyze data more effectively.

✨ Temporary Tables: Explored the use of temporary tables and their benefits in handling intermediate results during complex data operations.
